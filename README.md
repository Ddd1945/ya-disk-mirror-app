## Installation

### Python 3.12.3

1. Create and activate a virtual enviroment

2. Install libs from `requirements.txt`

3. Run `main.py`

4. App will be available at the address provided in `config.py`

## Usage

To test an application, login to default user. Login - `admin`, Password - `12345678`. Then, Paste to the search bar link to publicly available yandex disk. It might be a full link - `https://disk.yandex.ru/d/coIIrxEva7kPoQ` or just a public key - `coIIrxEva7kPoQ`. Press `search` button to get data from disk on website. By clicking on elemenets, you can navigate via folders (back and forth) and download files.

## Task:

Create a web application using Flask or Django that interacts with the Yandex.Disk API.

The application should implement the following functionality:

1. Viewing files on Yandex.Disk using a public link (public_key):
   After successful authorization, the user should be able to see a list of all files and folders stored under the provided public link.

2. Downloading specific files:
   The user should be able to select files from the list and download them to their local computer via the web application's interface.

## Technical requirements:

- Use Flask or Django as the web framework.

- Fetch the list of files from Yandex.Disk using the REST API.

- Implement the ability to download selected files from Yandex.Disk to the local computer.

- The application should have a simple web interface to display the list of files and provide buttons for downloading them.

## Additional requirements:

- You can use the `requests`/`aiohttp` library or any other HTTP client library to work with the Yandex.Disk API.

- Document the code, including type annotations.

- The code should be uploaded to GitHub or a similar service with a commit history.

## Evaluation criteria:

- Correct implementation of authorization and API interaction.

- Usability and simplicity of the interface.

- Readability and structure of the code.

- The presence of instructions for launching and using the application.

- Compliance with the technical and additional requirements of the task.

## Optional tasks (not mandatory, but would be a plus):

1. Implement file filtering by type (e.g., documents only or images only).

2. Allow downloading multiple files simultaneously.

3. Implement caching of the file list so that it doesnâ€™t have to be fetched from the server each time.
